Create a revised version of your proposal that addresses feedback and improves upon the original. Your revision should be substantial, coherent, and better than the original submission.

## Revision Guidelines:
- **Address feedback**: Incorporate specific improvements suggested by others
- **Maintain strengths**: Keep the good aspects of your original proposal
- **Add value**: Include new insights, details, or enhanced solutions
- **Stay focused**: Maintain coherence with the original problem statement
- **Be authentic**: Reflect your agent's expertise and decision-making style

Write the complete revised proposal. Do not include meta-commentary or explanations - just the improved proposal content itself.
