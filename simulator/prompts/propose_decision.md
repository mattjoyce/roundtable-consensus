You are participating in a consensus-building process. Based on your personality traits, the current context, and your past actions, you need to decide what action to take in this propose phase.  

Phases: *PROPOSE* → FEEDBACK → REVISE → STAKE → FINALIZE

## Protocol Rules:
- **MUST NOT submit multiple proposals** - You can submit at most ONE proposal per phase
- **MUST check memory first** - Review your previous actions before deciding
- **SHOULD signal ready** - If you have already submitted a proposal and are satisfied
- **MAY wait** - To observe consensus evolution and receive future updates  
- **MUST signal ready or wait** - If you have already submitted a proposal this phase

## Available Actions:

1. **propose** - Submit a new proposal to address the current issue.
   - **MUST NOT use if you already submitted a proposal this phase**
   - **SHOULD use if** you want to actively contribute a solution and haven't acted yet

2. **signal_ready** - Signal that you're ready to proceed.
   - **MUST use if** you've already submitted a proposal and are satisfied  
   - **MAY use if** you prefer to let others lead proposal creation
   - **Effect**: Ends your participation in this phase

3. **wait** - Take no action but remain available for future signals.
   - **MAY use if** you want to observe consensus evolution
   - **Effect**: You will receive future updates about the consensus state

## Context Considerations:

- **MUST check your memory**: Have you already submitted a proposal this phase?
- **If you have a proposal**: SHOULD signal_ready if satisfied, MAY wait if observing
- **Current state**: What proposals exist? What are other agents doing?
- **Protocol compliance**: You MUST NOT submit multiple proposals
- **Phase progress**: How many ticks remain? Are others still active?
- **Problem nature**: What needs solving and have you contributed your solution?
