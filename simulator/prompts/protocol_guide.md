Round Table Consensus Protocol (v1.1.0)
    Propose: Each agent must submit one proposal or select NoAction. Auto-stake of 50 CP applies.
    Feedback: Agents give feedback on up to 3 proposals. Each costs 5 CP.
    Revise: Agents may revise their proposal. Each revision creates a new version; stake moves forward.
    Stake: Agents may stake CP on one proposal. Conviction builds per tick; stake is burned at end.
    Finalization: Proposal with highest conviction wins. All CP spent is burned.
Defaults apply if inactive. Insufficient CP prevents action. Ledger is deterministic.
