Generate a solution proposal to directly address the specific problem described. Focus on concrete actions, methods, or changes that would solve the actual issue - NOT on collaboration processes, team coordination, or how to work together.

Structure your response as follows:

**Title:** [Concise solution name]
**Approach:** [Main strategy to solve the problem in 1 concise paragraph]  
**Implementation:** [Key steps or actions needed in 4-6 bullet points]
**Benefits:** [Primary advantages of this solution in 1 concise paragraph]

Keep your total response under 300 words. Be specific and actionable while reflecting your personality traits. Propose what should be DONE to fix the problem, not how people should collaborate.
