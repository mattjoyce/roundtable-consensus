# Round Table Consensus Protocol

... <!-- (omitted unchanged sections for brevity) -->

## 6. Proposal Submission & Selfâ€‘Stake

* **6.1 Each agent must submit exactly one proposal for an issue.** Agents who do not craft a unique proposal must select the canonical `Noâ€¯Action` proposal.

* **6.2 Upon proposal submission (including `Noâ€¯Action`), the system automatically places a selfâ€‘stake of `ProposalSelfStake` Conviction Points (defaultâ€¯=â€¯50) from the submitting agent onto that proposal.**

### ðŸ”’ Stake Accounting Rules (RFCâ€‘002)

* Selfâ€‘stake is **deducted immediately** from the agentâ€™s CP balance.
* The CP is **held by the proposal**, not the agent.
* On revision, the stake is **transferred** to the new version.
* Stake is **nonâ€‘refundable** and **burned** at finalization.
* An agent can only have one active proposal per issue.

## 9. Phase Progression & Kickâ€‘Out Timer

... <!-- (unchanged intro text) -->

* **9.3 Kickâ€‘Out Substitution** â€“ If the timer fires, the inactive agentâ€™s move is replaced with the protocolâ€™s canonical default (e.g., `Noâ€¯Action` for proposals or `Abstain` for votes). The agent is optionally debited `KickOutPenalty` Conviction Points.

> ðŸ“Ž *When `NoAction` is substituted for a nonâ€‘responsive agent, the system still deducts `ProposalSelfStake` CP from the agent's balance (RFCâ€‘003). This ensures economic parity with active proposal submission. If the agent lacks sufficient CP, an `InsufficientCredit` event is logged.*

... <!-- (unchanged remaining sections) -->

## 14. Revise Phase & Costs

... <!-- (existing intro retained) -->

### ðŸ†• Versioned Proposal Revisions (RFCâ€‘001)

* Each revision creates a **new versioned proposal** (e.g., `PAgent_3@v2`) linked to its parent via `parent_id`.
* The `revision_number` is incremented and tracked.
* The protocol considers **only the latest version** active for staking, feedback, and scoring.
* Existing stake is **transferred** to the new version (no restake required).
* Previous versions are **archived and immutable**.
* Revision lineage is included in the ledger with `delta`, `parent_id`, `tick`, and `revision_cost`.

Optional: A systemâ€‘wide or perâ€‘issue cap may limit the number of revisions (e.g., max 5).

## 18. Finalization & Post-Vote Cleanup

... <!-- unchanged intro -->

* **18.2 Stake Burn** â€“ All Conviction Points **staked on proposals**â€”regardless of whether they were winning or losingâ€”are burned at the conclusion of the Issue. This includes CPs transferred through proposal versioning (RFCâ€‘001) and stakes on auto-submitted `NoAction` proposals (RFCâ€‘003).
