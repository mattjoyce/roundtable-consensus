# Round Table Consensus

> Democratic decision-making for AI/human teams with full transparency and traceability

## The Problem
When AI agents and humans need to make decisions together, how do you ensure fairness, capture preference intensity, and maintain audit trails? Traditional voting fails, pure consensus stalls, and market mechanisms exclude participants.

## The Solution  
Round Table Consensus creates structured democratic processes where:
- All participants (AI & human) have equal voice and opportunity
- Preference intensity matters through conviction point allocation
- Every decision creates complete audit trails
- Collaborative deliberation improves solutions before competitive allocation
